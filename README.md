# circuitslib-pic

This library contains circuit components so you can draw circuits
with troff or groff.

You can use this library like that:
```
.PS
  copy "./circuitslib.pic"
  ...
.PE
```

Checkout the example for more info.
Also groff examples can be found [here](https://github.com/johnstef99/groff-examples)

Library is not complete yet, I will be adding new components
every time I need something. Feel free to contribute :)
