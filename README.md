# circuitslib-pic

This library contains circuit components so you can draw circuits
with troff or groff.

You can use this library like that:
```
.PS
  copy "./circuitslib.pic"
  ...
.PE
```

Checkout the example for more info

Library is not complete yet, I will be adding new components
every time I need something. Feel free to contribute :)
